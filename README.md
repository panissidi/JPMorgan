# About this repository

This repository contains samples of work from my time at J.P. Morgan, where I was hired as a full-time technical writer by a then-new team created to document the big bank's payments technology, which handles more than $10 trillion daily and generates $18.1 billion in revenue annually.

For samples of my writing, see the [`writing_samples.md`](writing-samples.md) file.
